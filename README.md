Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification models. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, with a focus on identifying fraudulent activities.

📂 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant financial issue worldwide. This project applies machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, precision, and recall. Techniques such as class imbalance handling, feature scaling, and neural networks have been applied.
